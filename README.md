# character-tools

Character tools is a web application created to make it easier for me to create and edit character cards.

Although it was originally intended to be a character card editor, the following features are planned to be implemented

- [x] Character Editor
  - [x] Import .json .png & .webp character card
  - [x] Export .png & .json character card
- [x] Character library: Save characters in a "on browser" library that use indexedDb
- [x] CharacterBook support
  - [x] CharacterBook Editor
  - [x] CharacterBook library
  - [x] CharacterBook sharing
- [ ] Response Formating
  - [ ] Context template editor
  - [ ] Instruct template editor
  - [ ] Context template library
  - [ ] Instruct template library
